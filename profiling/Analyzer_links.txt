Oracle Studio Analyzer:

In addition to serial and multi-thread profiling (OpenMP, Pthreads), the
latest versions of the Studio Analyzer support MPI profiling as well.

The best way to obtain an MPI profile is to run collect from the command
line (the GUI interface doesn't work, at least in the versions installed
on the DTU systems):

collect -M <MPI_version> mpirun -np <N> -- ./program

where MPI_version can be OpenMPI or CT8.1, N is the number of processors
you want to use, and program is your MPI program.  Please note the '--'
in the command - this is mandatory to indicate where the options to
mpirun end.
