TotalView: 

TotaView is the state-of-the-art debugger in HPC environments, and it is
capable of debugging parallel applications, both MPI and OpenMP.  It is
even possible to debug hybrid-parallel programs, i.e. MPI and OpenMP
mixed.  

There is also support for CUDA debugging.

DTU has a campus license for Linux, which is available to all machines
on the DTU network.

For students, DTU has an agreement with RogueWave (the company behind
TotalView), that DTU students can particpate in the TotalView Student
Express program, i.e. students can get a TotalView license for their own
computer.  If you are interested in that, please send me an e-mail with
you name, study-number and expected end of your studies.  I will then
send this information to RogueWave, and they will issue a licencse for
you.
