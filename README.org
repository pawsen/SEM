Spectral methods for FEM

** Install and compile
*** vtk
Install headers and libraries for C++:

*** cblas
Documentation:
http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/
or old-fashion 
http://www.netlib.org/blas/

Beside being implementations, BLAS and LAPACK are also API standard for basic linear algebra operations (such as vector and matrix multiplication).
So one can test with calls to blas, and then change to a optimized implementation, eg. Atlas or Openblas later.


cblas is a part of the blas installation(actually it is just an interface for calling the fortran library blas.so).
Pass all arguments by reference because of the Fortran implementation.
